**Metatranscriptome**
The collection of all RNA molecules (transcripts) in a microbial community.

**Metatranscriptomics**
The set of techniques used to study a metatranscriptome.

**Subtractive Hybridization**
A wet-lab technique that enriches a nucleic acid of interest by using nucleic acid probes that are reverse complementary to a depletion target, used commonly to target host RNA or microbial rRNA.

**Total RNA**
The collection of all forms of RNA in a cell or environment. Includes rRNA and tRNA which are typically not of interest make up a majority of the cellular RNA. The mRNA component (generally of interest) and noncoding small RNA account for a small proportion of total RNA.

**Transcriptome**
The collection of all RNA molecules (transcripts) in a cell or a population of cells.

**Transcriptomics**
The set of techniques used to study an organism's transcriptome.
